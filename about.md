# Who am I?
Guy who builds data-driven software and sets up cloud infrastructure for that addictive monthly salary. Take that away and I like to read internet journalism and Wikipedia too much, eat all the unhealthy stuff with relish, binge watch YouTube, occasionally cycle or play badminton, and try to finish at least one video game a year.

## Where am I?

All over the Delhi National Capital Region in India as far as the Delhi Metro can take me.

## Why am I?

God willed it.

Either that, or poor decision making by my parents.

## Quote to live & die by?

>"It matters not how strait the gate,
>   How charged with punishments the scroll,
>I am the master of my fate,
>   I am the captain of my soul."
>
> *- Invictus, William Ernest Henry*

## Why are you so strongly opinionated online?

मेरी मर्जी।
